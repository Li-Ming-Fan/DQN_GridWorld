# DQN_GridWorld
Dueling-Double-Deep-Q-Network. Reinforcement Learning. 

Variant based on https://github.com/awjuliani/DeepRL-Agents/blob/master/Double-Dueling-DQN.ipynb

With different (smaller) representation of game situations,
and different (smaller) feature-extraction convolutional layers.

Same tier outcome, Faster training process.
